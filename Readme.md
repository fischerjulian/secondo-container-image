# Secondo Container Image

## About Secondo

> Secondo is an extensible database system supporting especially non-standard applications. Designed at the FernUniversitÃ¤t in Hagen, Secondo is a platform for implementing and experimenting with various kinds of data models. [1]

> The Secondo system is extensible by algebra modules, using a well defined interface. New data models and data structures together with their operations are integrated into the system in this way. The source code is available and enables the user to access and modify every part of the database system. Secondo comes with a carefully written user manual, programmer's guide and installation instructions. [1]
